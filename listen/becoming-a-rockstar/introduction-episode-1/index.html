        <p>
          Hi there, I'm megabyteGhost and you're listening to the Becoming A Rockstar Podcast where you come with me on my journey from being a 9 to 5 day job person to a professional musician full-time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this episode we're gonna be doing sort of an introduction, it's the first episode, episode one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Never go full episode one, but here we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are going to talk about who I am, why I'm doing this, the reason for having a podcast, and the whole thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole shebang.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are watching this on YouTube, I just want you to know that you can go ahead and get the show notes over at megabyteghost.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're listening on the podcast, you can actually watch a video of me, I'm sitting here in my day job office early in the morning before my day job starts, and recording this.
        </p>
        <p>
          So you can check that out if you're into that.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yeah, that's it's let's get started.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the reason why, or what this is, is this is a podcast where I go from ... I'm documenting the journey of going from a 9 to 5 day jobber.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work as a communications director for a non- profit trade association called the American Institute of Building Design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love my job, it's an awesome day job.
        </p>
        <p>
          I meet a lot of really cool people, I work with my dad, that's pretty cool.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what I really care about is making music, and music has always been a really big thing for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always been really passionate about it ever since I was a kid.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember I don't know why I remember this, but I remember being a kid and having NSYNC and Backstreet Boys CDs playing on my PlayStation, and me and my cousins singing to all the songs and saying we were gonna start a singing group.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I would say that music was my first love, and growing up it was always this unobtainable thing to be a professional musician.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I went to college, I got a degree in video game design, and I worked for 10 years not in video games, but in marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I feel like that is going to help a lot with going from point A to point Z.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a lot of stops on the way, that's why it's not A to B. But here we are, and we're taking that journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          I turned 30 recently, and I guess that was sort of what got me thinking about hey is this really what I wanna be doing with my life? So I tried a bunch of different things.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've tried video games, I've tried ... I had actually a small amount of success streaming and YouTubing games, specifically World of Warcraft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, using my marketing knowledge of working in marketing for 10 years, that helped a lot with the success of those videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that is just a lot of work that I didn't really enjoy doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it was fun, but I decided that sitting around and playing video games all day was not actually what I wanted to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I wanted something with a little bit more freedom, I wanna be able to choose when I work and where I work.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again, music has always been a thing that I get really pumped up when a good song comes on. I really love live music.
        </p>
        <p>
          It just really speaks to me in a way that nothing else does.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it makes me happy in a way that nothing else does.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I know that music is the thing that I should be doing every day with my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I wanted to document the journey, which is what this podcast is. So the reason why I started a podcast specifically, and I said that this is a video too, you can watch this on YouTube or on megabyteghost.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's just kind of, honestly it's a part of the marketing plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          But also I wanna be able to look back and see, and document in public what things worked for me, and what has not worked for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then I wanna share that knowledge with people who also wanna go from being a 9 to 5er to a professional musician and have them skip a lot of the mistakes that I make.
        </p>
        <p>
          And just be able to go straight to doing what you wanna do, and you won't have to deal with a lot of the BS that I'm gonna go through, and I'm gonna talk about all of it publicly here on the podcast.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's kinda the point, is I'm documenting it for myself so that I can go back and look at it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I wanna document it publicly so that other people can learn from it too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because the cool thing, one of my favorite things about the music industry is that we're not competing as artists.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not setting up a business to make techno music, and then I have to outsell all the other techno artists.
        </p>
        <p>
          People are gonna listen to techno music, they're gonna buy all of our music if they like it.
        </p>
        <p>
          People who listen to drum and bass, they're gonna buy all the artists of drum and bass that they like.
        </p>
        <p>
          So there's no really competing, you're only competing with yourself in that aspect.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Cause we're all in this together, and that's another thing that I really love about the music industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I hope you enjoyed episode one, that's it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, megabyteghost.com/listen if you wanna go straight to the podcast information.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's also where you can listen to some of the music I've already produced.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've produced music probably for the last 15 years I've been producing electronic music.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I've released a little bit over time, and you can download it there, or just listen to it if you don't wanna buy it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's all on BandCamp, so you can just stream it straight from BandCamp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah, check it out, sign up for the newsletter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will let you know when new episodes come out if you sign up for the newsletter.
        </p>
        <p>
          So if you wanna know about that just go to megabyteghost.com and go sign up for the newsletter, and then I will notify you by email of new episodes that'll give you, there will be show notes and transcripts for those of you who are like me, and don't actually really like to listen to a whole lot of podcasts, prefer to read them.

        <p>
          I will have transcripts of every episode at megabyteghost.com as well as other ways to listen to it, ways to download it and stuff like that.
        </p>
        <p>
            So check that out, and I can't wait to see you next week.
